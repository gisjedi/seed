A primary intention of this standard is for simple job discovery from public images hosted within either Docker Hub,
Docker Trusted Registry or Docker Registry. There is significant fragmentation of APIs between the various Docker
offerings and the following sections describe the steps that may be taken to access the labels defined by Seed.

None of the Docker registry services support label search in any fashion. This incurs the requirement of applying a
secondary means to subset image results. The standard presently requires that all job images are named with the suffix
`-seed`. This allows for quick filtering of results to a manageable set for discovery.

=== Docker Hub
Docker Hub stores Docker image manifest information in a readily accessible format only for Automated Builds. This
enforces the need for all developersâ€  wishing to support simple discovery from Docker Hub to support Hub builds, as
opposed to local image builds followed by a docker push. Given this caveat, a service such as ImageLayers can be used
to quickly identify manifest content after discovering available images.

The following two steps may be taken to find and identify labels within Docker Hub:

* Perform HTTP GET to find Docker images:
** URL: https://hub.docker.com/v2/search/repositories/?query=-seed
* Perform HTTP POST to get label details for images found in previous request:
** BODY: {"repos":[{"name":"myorg/myjob-seed","tag":"latest"}]}
** URL: https://imagelayers.io/registry/analyze

The ImageLayers service is a 3rd-party service by CenturyLink Labs, but the source code is openly available at
https://github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/imagelayers[ImageLayers] and can be used as a reference implementation.

=== Docker Registry
Docker Registry does not natively support any type of search, but does provide a catalog API that allows for listing the
entire registry contents. Using this along with tag and manifest inspection will allow label inspection.

The following steps may be taken to find and identify labels of Seed compliant images within Docker Registry:

NOTE: All references to `{registry}`, `{image-id}` and `{tag}` in the following URLs should be replaced with your
environment specific values.

* Perform HTTP GET against catalog endpoint to find `-seed` suffixed images:
** URL: http://{registry}/v2/_catalog
* Perform HTTP GET against tags endpoint for each image matched:
** http://{registry}/v2/{image-id}/tags/list
* Perform HTTP GET against manifests endpoint to retrieve labels per tag (extract labels from history JSON member):
** http://{registry}/v2/{image-id}/manifests/{tag}

=== Docker Trusted Registry
There is a ticket in with Docker Trusted Registry team to natively support label search. Presently there is no API
support to inspect hosted images for label metadata. Images must be pulled locally for inspection.
